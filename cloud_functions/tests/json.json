  "caption": "There is a strong relationship between guard passing and taking an opponents back: We normally think of passing an opponents guard to the side, or occasionally to mount; but some of the most commonly occurring and profitable opportunities come in situations where opponents turn into defensive turtle positions to prevent giving up passing points. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE UPON THESE OPPORTUNITIES!! Not only can you potentially score more points with a back take than a guard pass, but in addition you are now in the single best finishing position in the sport. Keep you eyes open for the back when passing!!! Be ready to capitalize immediately upon the great opportunities in front of you!!",
